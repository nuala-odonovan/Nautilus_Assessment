This is a solution to a function consisting of four nested if/else statements. This solution optimizes readability, style, and simplicity by removing any nested if/else statements and re-factoring them so that they exist in the same scope. Checking for falsiness, instead of truthiness (e.g. "if not A" rather than "if A") allows for for an "early exit" of the function, rather than scanning lines and lines of nested checks.

Additionally, removing nested if/else statements optimizes maintainability because we can remove or add conditions without affecting the entire function.

```
def f():
	if not A:
		s()
		return false
	else:
		z()
	if not B: 
		t()
		return  false
	else:
		y()
	if not C:
		u()
		return false
	else:
		x()
	if not D: 
		v()
		return false
    else:
        w()
        return true

```
